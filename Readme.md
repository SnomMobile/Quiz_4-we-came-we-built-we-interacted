# Quiz 4 - we came; we built; we interacted

This is the last `quiz`... you've made it through:

- Quiz 1: `setup and soundbeats`
	- do you remember your first template clone into robots?
  - what about your reaction to `how do I make an emotion with code`? 
  - or changing `just one thing`?

- Quiz 2: `classy robot family`
	- do you know where your `classy` children are?
	- what about their parents? 
	- do you remember how similar `OOP` is when we looked at `processing.py` vs `p5.js`?

- Quiz 3: `message in a bottle`
  - you are no longer limited to `one file - one location`!
  - smile! There will be a surprize sent to your `GPS` next week!
  - interacting digitally across space and time (in just a few lines..)

## Let's look back
